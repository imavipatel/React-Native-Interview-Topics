* Use tools like **Snyk**, **OWASP Dependency-Check**  
* Avoid exposing **secrets/env variables** in bundles  
* Configure **error boundaries** to avoid sensitive error leakage  
* Ensure secure API integration (HTTPS, signed requests)  

### ðŸš€ Performance  
* Use **React.memo / PureComponent** for expensive renders  
* Split large bundles with **dynamic imports & code splitting**
